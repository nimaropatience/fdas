    "Abstract data types are the specifications of data types.It focuses on what the data type does and not how it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key roles  of ADT include :\n",
    "- Abstraction and Simplification :This focuses on what the data type does and not how it does it and also shields users from internal workings from the data type.It also provides a simplified interface for interacting with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: ADT'S store data and operations done on data into a single unit and ensure data protection and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structure independence: Implementations by the data structure on an ADT can be done without affecting the code and adjustments on specific needs can be made without extensive code modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity and Reusability: Complex systems can be built from smaller,independent units and it easiy to understand and reuse code in different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information hiding: It does not allow access to internal data ad only exposes an interface  to a user and protects data from malicious changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software Engineering principles: it encourages good softwre engineering practces by promoting abstraction, modularity and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The differences between ADT and data structures are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Data structure deals with the representation of data in memory while an ADT deals with the behavior and operations of a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An ADT is independent of any specific implementation while a Data structure is a concrete realization of an ADT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples of ADT'S inclued lists,stacks, queues and graphs while examples of data structures include arrays,linked lists,hash tables and binary tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An ADT describes what a data type can do and the operations which can be performed on it  while a data structure implements a data type by specifying how the data is organized and stored in memory along with the algorithms for manipulating it.\n",

    "-  Arrays\n",
    "Arrays are data structures that store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. \n",

    "Linked lists are a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, called nodes.\n",
    "each node contains data and  a link to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stacks are a type of data structure that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. \n",
    "This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "append: Adding an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop: Removing the top element from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peek/Top: Accessing the top element without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.\n",
    "This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to its child node.\n",
